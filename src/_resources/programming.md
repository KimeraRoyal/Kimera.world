title: Programming Resources
---

A collection of programming [resources](..). I deeply dislike a lot about our current programming environment (hah) - the attitudes, philosophies, various happenings, etc, are very uncomfortable to me. I have never programmed because I think it will (or should) make me a million dollars, or because I dream in code, or because I love doing daily programming challenges to prepare for interviews. I program because if I do not my head will explode. Programming is a deeply humiliating and personal experience for me, which is why I love it so much. With that said, the kind of things I find interesting programming-wise will reflect these opinions.

I have a separate page for [homebrew resources](../homebrew), because in my mind they are different but related things. I also have a separate page for [game design resources](../game-design) because they are actually different disciplines that happen to share some overlapping areas, especially at the implementation end. With that said I am a game developer so the kind of programming things I look into will probably be at least tangentially game design related.
