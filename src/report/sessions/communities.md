The specific presentation I want to talk about here is [Measuring Group Creativity of Dialogic Interaction Systems by Means of Remote Entailment Analysis](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3648188.3675140). Perhaps I misunderstand what the research aims were here, but I felt the notion of measuring creativity by comparing word likelihood is completely [misguided](authoring#authoring-educational-hypercomics-assisted-by-large-language-models).

I bounced off of the finer details of this presentation, so I may be fully misinterpreting their research aims, and because of that I don't want to spend multiple lines ranting about something that I don't even understand the point of. I *did* come away from this presentation with positive outcomes - specifically, that I should contemplate what to do when [a presentation leaves me feeling negative emotions](../takeaways#how-do-you-respond-to-strong-negative-feelings-about-a-presentation).
