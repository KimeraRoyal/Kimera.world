# Know Your Audience
With the [exhibition](exhibiting), there were some considerations in my mind:
- Are people there for you, specifically? Is it just an exhibition, or within a wider event?
- What type of person is going to be attending? Is there a specific age range, demographic, career field, set of interests?
- Will your work be out of place compared to everything else?
- Are the attendees going to be the kind of people who "get it", or are you bringing your FPS to the strategy game faire?
- Will the people attending be able to get your contact information?
- Will the people attending *want* to get your contact information?

What creates anxiety for me is that my projects are not made for any specific events. It would be a fun challenge to make something with a specific exhibition in mind, but when you're showing off pre-existing work you just have to hope you're a good fit.

I'm happy that [people](people) at Hypertext liked [my work](https://kimeraroyal.itch.io/parabolic-emotion), but there's still a lot of anxiety in worrying about how other people will think. Talking to other exhibitors at least helped me to remember that this is a situation everybody else is in as well.
