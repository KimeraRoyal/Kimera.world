# People
Hypertext was an amazing opportunity to meet other people, some of whom have researched the field for decades while others were attending the conference for the first time alongside me. I tried my best to treat everyone evenly - to not only stick to people close to my age and experience, and to not idolise more knowledgeable attendees or act like they are above me.

It's exciting to finally be in the position where everybody *is* my peer, even if some of them have been attending the conference for far longer than me. I made some friends, exchanged some business cards, but really have [no clue how to follow up with people](takeaways#i-have-no-idea-how-to-follow-up-after-a-conference).
