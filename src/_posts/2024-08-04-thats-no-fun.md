## Introduction (100 Words)
Games shouldn’t be fun.

Maybe that’s a loaded opener - “games shouldn’t _need to_ be fun” is a more reasonable way to word it. Regardless, I want to focus on one key point: focusing too much on “fun” as a target for game design is a waste of time. It’s subjective, it’s counterproductive, and it squanders the potential of games as a creative and artistic medium. I want to advocate for games that try to be fun but fail in some way, games that try to be something other than fun, and games that actively try to _not_ be fun.
